Differential Abundance Analysis  is a vital statistical task in the analysis of microbiome data. Addressing the distinctive challenges inherent in microbiome abundance data, such as compositional effects, zero inflation, overdispersion, and high dimensionality, this study introduces the Microbial Abundance Data Vector Decomposition Model (MAVD)
